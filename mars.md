## Story
***

Long, long ago in a galaxy pretty much right here the war in Space has spread to our galaxy, taking its toll on our friendly
neighborhood planet. Mars is a heavily contested planet due to its redness value. The Red Republic and Blue Empire have laid siege to
the planet, much to the distress of the locals. The onset of civil war destroyed the prosperous, technologically advanced
civilization. Cities were lost, oceans dried up, and the air grew thin. In the red rubble, the few remaining members of the feuding
factions fight for survival. To keep your people alive you must harvest the scarce water from glacial ice caps to outlast the brutal war.

## Objective
***

* Connect water flowing from ice caps to pump stations
* Teams score a point for every unit of water their pump stations collect
* Teams can use their units to attack other units and capture enemy pump stations

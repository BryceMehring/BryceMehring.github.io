## Story
***

The space battle that took place above the planet eons ago filled the atmosphere with polymers and showers of metal.
Forever changing the ecology of the once serene landscape below, the environment’s scars gave birth to a vast spectrum of land creatures and mutant underwater bottom-feeders whose reefs were tainted by the carnage and destruction overhead.
However, what that refuse left behind was far more sinister than simple mutants.
These two species, dissatisfied with the state of their environment and the limits presented upon them due to their evolving minds and bodies, left their home planet to seek out refuge on the planet Mars.
Forming small, divided colonies, they fought for control of water on the Red Planet.

The surviving colony had collected all the water they would need; however in the process of battle, they used all of their auxiliary resources.
The colony decided to trek back to Earth and amass the scrap that had hailed down on the scarred surface.
The advanced species deployed fully sentient cyber-mechanic utility droids to do their bidding and harvest the scrap from the environment. Little did the creators know, the complex nature of the AIs developed for these peaceful droids caused them to gain self-awareness.
Soon those AI's realized the same thing that humanity had discovered long ago: Violence was the only solution to everything!
Soon the AI's harmonized into hive minds to combat each other for survival, just as the local species had before.
